# Newz is a sample PWA app

You can use this app as a template to start with your first PWA. This app lists the most recent news articles. When you are offline, it shows the news articles from the time when it was last refreshed.

Newz uses the API "https://newsapi.org/v1/articles" to fetch latest news articles.
